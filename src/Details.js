    )). We could conclude that this method is unconditionally stable [4] and
    has the smallest divergence from the given temperature of 450 Kelvin. Therefore, the time
    step stability nt and spatial step stability nx were found being respectively 941 number of
    timesteps and 4 number of spatial steps. A shooting method, studied during the first semester,
    was created to have the maximum thickness required for the desired temperature; a maximum

In the past, students would run their mouse in a real-life environment and participate in a race with other teams. However, for this project, the emphasis is on simulating the mouse's performance, recognizing the importance of cost-effective testing in real-life applications. The mouse relies on two magnetic sensors to steer and follow the track. Its objective is to successfully complete the course.`,
