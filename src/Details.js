    )). We could conclude that this method is unconditionally stable [4] and
    has the smallest divergence from the given temperature of 450 Kelvin. Therefore, the time
    step stability nt and spatial step stability nx were found being respectively 941 number of
    timesteps and 4 number of spatial steps. A shooting method, studied during the first semester,
    was created to have the maximum thickness required for the desired temperature; a maximum
    thickness of 0.568mm was computed for a temperature of 450K which is the one we are not
    allowed to exceed.`,

    description: `This report focuses on the design of an electronic control system for an AGV (automated guided vehicle), commonly known as a "mouse". The AGV follows a taped-down wire as a guide. Due to the pandemic, physical construction of the mouse was not possible, so a detailed circuit simulation and mechanical analysis will be provided instead. In the past, students would run their mouse in a real-life environment and participate in a race with other teams. However, for this project, the emphasis is on simulating the mouse's performance, recognizing the importance of cost-effective testing in real-life applications. The mouse relies on two magnetic sensors to steer and follow the track. Its objective is to successfully complete the course.`,

    user is able to interact with the fan via the extension board and the Nucleo Board. Further
    instructions or input from the user are communicated via the LCD. The use is able to choose
    the pre-set fan speed (open-loop control) or rotate the encoder and potentiometer to vary the
    fanâ€™s speed (closed-loop control). Optimization of the fan response and precision in user input
